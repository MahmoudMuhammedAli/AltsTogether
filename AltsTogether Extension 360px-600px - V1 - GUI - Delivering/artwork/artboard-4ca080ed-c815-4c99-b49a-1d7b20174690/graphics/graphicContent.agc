For Services under a Plan, on the first day of each billing period, you will pay us the applicable fees (the “Base Fees”) and any applicable taxes based on the Services in the plan that you selected (the “Selected Plan”). In addition, we may, for particular Services as defined in your Order, issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your Selected Plan (the “Applicable Threshold”) based on your use of the Services during the previous billing period (the “Overage Fees” and, together with the Base Fees, the “Fees”) as those Overage Fees are defined in your Plan.

We may bill you more frequently for Fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the Fees for use of the Service Offerings in U.S. dollars unless otherwise agreed to in writing. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding.

We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.\n\n4.3 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All Fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.\n\n5. Temporary Suspension; Limiting API Requests.\n5.1 Generally.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.\n\n11. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n\n11.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy (“Claim”) relating in any way to this Agreement, the Site, or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 11, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\n\n11.1.1 If you are located in the United States: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n\n11.1.2 If you are located in the United Kingdom: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, your use of the Services, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.\n\n11.1.3 If you are located in any territory that is not specifically enumerated in Sections 11.1.1 or 11.1.2, you may elect for either of Section 11.1.1 or 11.1.2 to apply to you, otherwise this agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Ireland. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, your use of the Services, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland.\n\n11.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\n11.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: via email at notices@consensys.net with subject line LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
